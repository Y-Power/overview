OverView, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
GPL is a friend and, if you are not familiar with it, you should really [learn more about it](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html).

OverView is based on the GREAT work of Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2016 Automattic, Inc.
Underscores is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

Normalizing styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

== Description ==

A minimalist yet colorful responsive theme, OverView delivers a one-page browsing experience: all posts can be dinamically shown one by one on the OverView Display -available as page templates- by clicking on simple navigation buttons, helping engagement with your content.

OverView is based on Underscores, powered by the WordPress REST API and features an unlimited Google font selection, many color schemes and several styled widgets, wide layouts with CSS grid and flex support -including fallbacks for older devices.

All free (GNU GPL), because the best things in life are.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the OverView's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I activate the OverView Display? =
The Display is available as a WordPress page template, available in the page editor -> Page Attributes.

= I activated the OverView Display: how do I customize it? =
The Display options will be visible in the WordPress Customizer -under the **OverView options** section- when visiting a page with an active OverView Display page template.

= I activated the OverView Display template and it does not show anything/it does not work. Why? =
Some plugin might be blocking the Display: it usually depends on security plugins, blocking the WordPress REST API, on which the Display relies, by default: make sure to check your plugins options allow the WordPress REST API on your website.

= Does OverView support any plugins? =

OverView includes support for Infinite Scroll in Jetpack.
